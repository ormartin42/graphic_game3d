  How to test the program ?
</h3>
<p align="center">
  Run the following command in your terminal <br><br>
  <i>make && ./cub3D [path_to_map] [--save]</i><br><br>
  You have a few map configurations to choose from in the maps folder. If you add the [--save] option, an image of the initial window view will be saved. That's it  !
